## Running the Project

Once all dependencies have been installed, you can start the project using the command

`npm run dev`

This will run the express server on port 5000, and the react app on port 3000.

The app should automatically open up in your default web browser, if it doesn't, you can open it manually by going to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
